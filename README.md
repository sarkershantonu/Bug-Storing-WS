# Bug web service 
This is a small webservice for storing bug in a table. 
The main idea is to store bug in HSQLDB and use this webservice to practice REST webservice testing using tools/framework.  


# run from IDE or with code
mvn clean release 

mvn spring-boot:run

# Deploy and run from JAR
mvn clean package

=> this will generate a Jar file in target folder. The name of the jar file will be "spring-boot-webservice-1.0.SNAPSHOT.jar" 
so, you need to copy that and put in any folder you like. This is standalone runner (jetty server built in) . Now, from commandline 

java -jar <generated jar>

# URL config 
Host : localhost

Port :9100

URL/Paths : 

1. To see all bugs : GET : /table/bugs
2. To save a bug: POST : /table/bugs
3. To see a bug : GET : /table/bugs/{id}
4. To Update a Bug: PUT : /table/bugs/{id}
5. To Delete a Bug : DELETE : /table/bugs/{id}
